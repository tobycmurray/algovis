# Algovis

Algovis is a rudimentary tool designed to enable the interactive
visualisation of simple algorithms implemented in Python, via Jupyter
Notebooks.

See the [documentation](https://tobycmurray.github.io/algovis/algovis-doc.html)
for instructions on how to download and use it.

## Credits

Algovis was created to aid teaching the introductory algorithms
subject *COMP90038 - Algorithms and Complexity* at the University of
Melbourne. It was created by Toby Murray (toby.murray@unimelb.edu.au)
with contributions from Zongdong (Ethan) Liu.
